Program for my internship class

 You have been hired to create a student tracking system to support student/instructor lab time documentation.
Create a program to keep track of when a student arrives and when a student leaves a lab. Also allow an instructor to sign in and sign out of the system.

Data that should be track include, student, instructor, courses, locations (campus, building, room) and times.Create a report that will produce a list of instructors and the students that visited the lab under those instructors broken down by date.
 
You can use any development environment you choose, e.g. Python, ASP.Net, C#, Java, PHP, C++, etc. The data can be stored in a flat file or database but should include documentation on the structure of the data. Make sure you provide instructions on how to install, setup and use the application as well. If you have MySQL, SQL Server or Oracle as your database, include all the scripts necessary to load data in your database. I can setup up a database and run the scripts when grading your project. If your project needs to be hosted in IIS, Apache or other web environment please make sure that is documented and any additional modules that need to be installed need to be clearly identified.
 
My recommendation would be to create a native app that would run without the need for additional setup. An example of this would be SQLite which works in Java, .Net and other environments, xbase databases such as Firebird or Access or flat file csv or json text files that would work well in Python, C#, Java and most every other language.
If you have any questions, please ask them early. This is a significant project.

Usability and functionality should be the prime objectives. You have creative control but please see the rubric to make sure you know what you will be graded on.

This submission should include:
 ·A zip containing your project files and your database with instructions on how to setup your project. If you use a flat file, xbase database or SQLite for your database, just make sure your hard coded paths are relative.
 · A narrated Jing video in which you describe the operation and features of your project or a Word document that is descriptive enough to function as complete documentation for your application. This documentation should make it possible for a non-technical person to install and use your application.
 *  Review the rubric as it is the guide faculty will use for grading.
